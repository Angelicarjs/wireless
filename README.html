    <h1>QGIS Plugin - Wireless Analysis</h1>
    <p>The QGIS plugin performs the following tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Intersect potential clients with specific problematic areas (SPA) where internet service is needed.</li>
        <li>Calculate weighted centroids based on the distribution of potential clients.</li>
        <li>Generate buffers around centroids with a user-defined distance parameter.</li>
        <li>Generate buffers around existing towers based on another user-defined distance parameter.</li>
        <li>Count the number of potential clients per tower within a given buffer.</li>
        <li>Evaluate fiber availability for the identified towers.</li>
        <li>Filter towers based on height (only towers with height â‰¤ 175 feet will be considered).</li>
        <li>Remove towers with no eligible clients in their vicinity.</li>
        <li>Generate the final output layer that includes:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Number of towers per SPA</li>
            <li>Average tower height</li>
            <li>Sum of eligible clients</li>
            <li>Number of towers with fiber connectivity</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Configuration to Run the Tool</h2>
    <p>To run this tool, you need to have a PostgreSQL database connected called <strong>wireless</strong>. Additionally, a schema named <strong>example</strong> should be created, containing the layers found in the data folder.
    This layers belong to Louisiana

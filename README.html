# QGIS Plugin - Wireless Analysis

The QGIS plugin performs the following tasks:

- Intersect potential clients with specific problematic areas (SPA) where internet service is needed.
- Calculate weighted centroids based on the distribution of potential clients.
- Generate buffers around centroids with a user-defined distance parameter.
- Generate buffers around existing towers based on another user-defined distance parameter.
- Count the number of potential clients per tower within a given buffer.
- Evaluate fiber availability for the identified towers.
- Filter towers based on height (only towers with height â‰¤ 175 feet will be considered).
- Remove towers with no eligible clients in their vicinity.
- Generate the final output layer that includes:
  - Number of towers per SPA
  - Average tower height
  - Sum of eligible clients
  - Number of towers with fiber connectivity

## Configuration to Run the Tool

To run this tool, you need to have a PostgreSQL database connected called **wireless**. Additionally, a schema named **example** should be created, containing the layers found in the data folder.  
These layers belong to Louisiana.
